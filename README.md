# WP_CustomContent
Inserting custom content into wordpress posts 

Aims of this wordpress plugin are to allow content to be written in HTML files rather than in the wordpress text editor which can be quite limiting. 
Ideally, the plugin will allow a wysiwyg type interface to make editing more streamlined. It will also include functionality to include custom css and custom js.
